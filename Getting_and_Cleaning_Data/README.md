## Course Project

Final course project for Getting and Cleaning Data course. Contains R code which does analysis on two data sets containing gyroscope data
from smartphones. Code loads data into R, combines two data sets, assigns column labels as well as corresponding subject and activity data,
and then reduces it to a smaller, tidy data set which is written to a txt file.
